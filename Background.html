	<h1 align="center"><i>What is Web Design?</i></h1>
	<p align="center">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
    <br>refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
    <br>development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
    <br>browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
    <br>become ever-increasingly important.</p>
